As a commission artist, live painter and art teacher, Desire with an "E" (aka: Desiree Kim of Rising Zen) has a genuine love for humanity and a deep desire to help others **release stress and feel empowered in daily life.**

Desiree is multifaceted, as her mediums include, but are not limited to painting, sculpting, airbrushing and photography. **Her personal experience with life's challenges is what has driven her to seek Zen and thus, share her findings with others in a positive way.**

Along her journey, she has found healing and positive energy by tapping into the ancient oriental practice of Qigong. She also uses guided imagination play as part of her daily life and intuitive art practices during the creative process.

**Whether creating art in retreat, during a live-art performance or as an instructor**,****she uses and/or shares Qigong and imagination play to release stress and free up energy in herself and her students in a balanced way.****These practices provide an amazing pathway, allowing intuition to assist the creation of inspired art full of meaning. Art created in this way, **maintains as a powerful and visual reminder** of the beautiful and energized state of empowerment.

Commissioning art or requesting a live painting from Desiree is not just obtaining art or a service. Joining her for art instruction is not just being instructed. Rather, these **experiences **are filled with a sense of **relaxation, stress-relief and play** that nurture the inner self and support the creation of a self-empowered piece of art... a visual representation of _the inner _voice.

**Let the art speak for you....Enter the experience of Desire With An E.**
